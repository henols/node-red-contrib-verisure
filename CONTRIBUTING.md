## Feel free
Feel free to contribute or start a new project based on this. As this is for node-red flows, the nodes itself are meant to be 
small and specific with regards to functionality/purpose. 
Ie the existing node pulling armed/disarmed status should only do this. If a complete site overview is needed, this should be a specific
node for this purpose. Same goes for potential nodes interacting with devices.

Happy to just receive feedback and other input as well.
